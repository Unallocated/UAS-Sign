Deployment
----------

This project is built on the Sinatra DSL and can be deployed in many different ways.
You can read about deploying Sinatra applications [here](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/deployment).

The files included here will work for a unicorn/ngnix deployment.

More information about deployment will be included here in the future.
